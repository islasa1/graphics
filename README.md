# Graphics Renderer
''This is not a very complex renderer''

## Summary
A simple 2/2.5D "graphics" rendering scheme. The basis of this graphics
engine is to make a highly modular API that allows plug-and-play
mechanics. The underline implementation of how the graphics should
not matter to the end user, and the baseline will be based upon
curses graphics ( ASCII art [insert link here] ), but ideally the project
should be extensible to other forms of graphics.
